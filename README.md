# React-Jobs

I created this website using React, Vite and Node.js. This is for employers to post job listings, and for applicants to view said postings. While this is currently geared towards developer positions, this can be easily adapted to generalize and include any type of job.

One of the aspects I am currently working on adding is an authentication system that will authenticate employers such that only employers may add, edit and delete job listings. Another aspect is to add a filtering system when looking through job positions. Filters that I'd like to add include, but are not limited to, job type, salary range and location.

As this is a locally hosted website, to run this website, you must download the files and directories to your local computer first. As this is a locally hosted website, you must open two terminals in the downloaded project directory.

To run the script, type 'npm run dev' in one terminal, and click the localhost link that appears.

In the second terminal, type 'npm run server' to run the JSON server.

That's it! The website is fully functional.

This is inspired from Traversy Media's React Course.
