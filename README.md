# React-Jobs

I created this website using React, Vite and Node.js. This is for employers to post job listings, and for applicants to view said postings. While this is currently geared towards developer positions, this can be easily adapted to generalize and include any type of job.

The purpose of this website was for me to learn React and other tools.

One of the aspects I am currently working on adding is an authentication system that will authenticate employers such that only employers may add, edit and delete their respective job listings. I also wish to implement a search system, allowing users to quickly find job positions by their titles. Another aspect is to add a filtering system when looking through job positions. Filters that I'd like to add include, but are not limited to, job type, salary range and location.

# Usage
This project uses a JSON-Server for a mock backend.

# Install Dependencies
`npm install`

# Run JSON-Server
The server will run on http://localhost:8000

`npm run server`

# Run Vite Frontend
React will run on http://localhost:3000

`npm run dev`

# Build for Production
`npm run build`

# Preview Production Build
`npm run preview`


That's it! The website is fully functional.

This is inspired from Traversy Media's React Course.
